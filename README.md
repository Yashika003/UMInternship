Data Science Projects

This repository contains a collection of data science projects implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
Each notebook explores a real-world dataset and applies appropriate EDA, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation techniques.
The projects cover diverse domains including climate analytics, healthcare, finance, customer support, and public health.
